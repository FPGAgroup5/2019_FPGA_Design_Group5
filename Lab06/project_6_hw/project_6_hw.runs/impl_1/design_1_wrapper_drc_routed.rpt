REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/conv_processor_0/inst/conv_processor_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/n_ctrl1/conv_ctrl_i/mem_i/mem_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/conv_processor_0/inst/conv_processor_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/n_ctrl1/conv_ctrl_i/mem_i/mem_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[10] (net: design_1_i/conv_processor_0/inst/conv_processor_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/n_ctrl1/conv_ctrl_i/mem_i/address2[6]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/conv_processor_0/inst/conv_processor_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/n_ctrl1/conv_ctrl_i/addr_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
